# Project

## GlowGo E-Commerce App (React.js)

As part of the development of the GlowGo E-Commerce App using React.js, we aimed to create a user-friendly and feature-rich platform for online shopping. Key contributions to the project include:

- Implemented a responsive design for optimal user experience across devices.
- Integrated a robust search functionality to enhance product discovery.
- Developed a detailed product display showcasing images, prices, and descriptions.
- Implemented a seamless shopping cart and checkout process for a hassle-free shopping experience.
- Introduced user account functionality to personalize the shopping experience.

This project not only showcases the capabilities of React.js but also emphasizes our commitment to delivering a top-notch e-commerce platform.

## Dependencies

GlowGo relies on the following key dependencies:

- [react-slick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slick): A responsive carousel component for React.
- [slick-carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slick-carousel): Slick carousel jQuery plugin, required by `react-slick`.
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): A set of customizable icons for React applications.
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start): Declarative routing for React.js.

Make sure to install these dependencies using npm or yarn before running the application.
npm install react-slick slick-carousel react-icons react-router-dom

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
